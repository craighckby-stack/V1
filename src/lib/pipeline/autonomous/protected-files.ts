/**
 * Files the self-improvement system must NOT modify (it would break its own
 * loop, gates, or control surface).
 *
 * SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH (audit 2: "duplicated protected lists have
 * drifted"). This list used to exist in TWO places that had diverged:
 *   - self-enhance-loop.ts protected the verifier + push path
 *     (push-target.ts, in-memory-typecheck.ts, verify-refactor.ts) but not
 *     the task generator;
 *   - self-task-generator.ts protected itself but NOT the verifier or push
 *     path — so the task engine could queue LLM-driven edits against the
 *     very gates that are supposed to check those edits.
 *
 * Both modules now import this set. Adding a file here protects it
 * everywhere at once.
